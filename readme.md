#Installing and Running the server
Once you have Node.js installed you can run the command "npm install serve -g" (up to this point - sorry if the command has changed) to install the server and then feel free to run your app by typing "serve" in the main project directory and see your app in action through the URL the command line will provide. 


#Installing and Running SASS (CSS preprocessor)

Ok, now that you have Node.js installed and you know how to run the server, it's time to see some beauty on your screen. Let's add our CSS preprocessor and have some more fun. "npm install node-sass" this is the code you'll use to add the CSS preprocesor, SASS. Once you're finished you can then run this code on your command line  "node-sass app\components\content\sass\ -o app\components\content\css\" that it will produce the following: get my style.scss file inside the app\components\content\sass\ folder and create my style.css inside app\components\content\css\ directory.
